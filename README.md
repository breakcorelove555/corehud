## Custom HUD for Team Fortress 2

### Introduction 
Since most of the HUDs that I've ever used I just don't like or switch between too much, I've decided to make my own and post it here privately to myself and friends. In here you'll get to download and use it,
apply changes yourself since I'll explain in some detail on how you can customize it for yourself if there's some things you want to change and etc.

### Contents of the HUD + extras
It will include the HUD itself, custom backgrounds (optional, will also explain how to add those), custom music (also optional and will be explained on how to add those), mods that change a variety of things (will be added troughout dev).
